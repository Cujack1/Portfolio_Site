1. style.css for Hero Page - adjust responsiveness for all screen sizes, even
   the weird ones.
2. style.css for Hero Page - "Curtis Jackson" is hidden when page resizes to be
   'shorter'. (A) --> I could make a second "Curtis Jackson" in the negative
   space that mirrors it's position and is only visible outside of the DIV
   containing the main "curtis Jackson" (B) --> Or I could make the page
   responsive to height changes specifically.
3. contact.css - needs custom attribute colors set in :root. (buttons,
   background colors, text, etc...)
4. .backSplash - change all CSS files to --- 'width: auto;'
5. my_projects.css - get rid of 'Bungee Inline'
